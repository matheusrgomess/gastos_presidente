# Analyzing Presidential Card Expenses from Brazil

This Jupyter Notebook aims to analyze the presidential card expenses of the President of Brazil using official data. The notebook utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

## Introduction

The presidential card expenses in Brazil represent the financial transactions made by the President's office for various purposes such as travel, accommodation, meals, and other official expenses. Analyzing these expenses can provide insights into the spending patterns and allocation of resources by the President's office.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the official government records, specifically the Transparency Portal of the Federal Government of Brazil. The dataset contains information about the presidential card expenses over a certain period, including the date, amount, description, and purpose of the expense.

## Notebook Content

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and an initial exploration of the data is performed to understand its structure and content.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Data cleaning steps are carried out to handle missing values, data inconsistencies, and format conversion. Additionally, the data is prepared for analysis by categorizing expenses and extracting relevant information.

3. **Data Visualization**: The cleaned and prepared data is visualized using Matplotlib to gain insights into the overall expense trends and patterns.


## Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the required Python libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`).
3. Open the notebook (`presidential_card_expenses.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the instructions and run each cell sequentially to execute the code and generate the visualizations.
